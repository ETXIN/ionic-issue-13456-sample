# ionic-issue-13456-sample

When I have two ion-content in the page and place them horizontally inside an ion-content, there is a problem when I navPush the page. ion-header and ion-footer's transition are working correctly (slide in from right to left) except the inner ion-content.

But this problem doesn't show in the last ion-content.
